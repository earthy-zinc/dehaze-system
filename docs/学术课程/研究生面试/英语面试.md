# English interview

## 1. why are you apply for (or register for) this major?

This is a long story. First of all, I studied financial management in university, which is very helpful to my daily life and work. It changed my thought to look at the world, make me have a more financial view to look at economy in our country. But I also watched how computer science influence the world. Just talk about accountant , we used to bookkeeping by pens and papers, but it will consume a lot of time and people to do it. Accounting software have changed it .we leave some complex and repetitive things to the computer do. But the world is complicated. There are still many things that have not been implemented by computers. And I want to know how computer did it and promote its development using my financial and computer knowledge. Chongqing University of Posts And Telecommunications is a famous university in southwest of China, which is very good at computer and telecommunication science. And the campus has a beautiful environment located at the foot of the mountain. I am deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere when connecting to the web site of our university. So this is why I apply for our university to study software engineering.

注记：先说明大学所学专业的好处，再说明计算机对世界带来的影响。从会计师记账的角度出发说明软件对这一行业的影响，然后说明还有很多内容没有被实现。我想要运用自己所学参与计算机行业发展。随后说明报考重庆邮电大学原因，学校的优点，环境、学术等。结尾总结。

## 2.talk about your drawback.

(In major)I think my disadvantage most concentrate in lack of professional knowledge of computer science. Most students who studied computer science usually have a lot of time to practice in software engineering, programming and algorithm. But in my college life, I often do my own major, which is not really relative to computer. But if I passed the exam and be admitted to postgraduate school, I will work hard to keep study, fill the gap in professional knowledge.

(In daily life)

注记：最大的缺点集中于缺乏计算机专业的知识，大多数学生在本科学习期间有大量时间学习编写软件，算法，而我主要是学习我自己的专业课程，和计算机关系不大，但是如果我通过了这次考试我会努力学习填补专业知识上的空缺。

## 3.and then talk about your advantage.

(In major)I think my advantage is that I can concern the process of software engineering in the sense of economic view. This is very important in the process of computer software development. Because software development needs to consume human and material resources. Sometimes it does not completely rely on technology in some aspects. Sometimes it is necessary to comprehensively consider the cost, time and other factors in software development. These things have been gradually established in my undergraduate study during the past four years. So I think this is my advantage to study software engineering.

(In daily life)My biggest advantage is that I can try my best to do something well. When I finish a job and it is turns out just as I'd planned. I will feel a real sense of accomplishment. give me the power to continue.

注记：优点是能用经济学的观点看待软件工程，对软件开发很重要，因为开发软件需要耗费人力物力，需要综合考虑消耗的时间和金钱成本。这些在我四年本科学习中已经培养了这方面的意识。

## 4.which books have you read? what is the most impressive books for you?

Actually I seldom read books in this year. If I want to learn something I prefer watching video rather than books. Because it is very intuitive and easy to understand. Indeed, we can not learn everything from video. So I download some electronic books to my computer, such as c prime plus. When I learning c programing language. The explanation of some concept in this book is very clear, so I would turn to this book if I did not understand some question. It give me a lot of help.

注记：很少读书，主要看视频，但是会下载电子书，学习C时，会看c prime plus，这本书概念清晰，所以有不会的会转向这本书。他给了我很多帮助。

## 5.what is your favorite course during your university?




## 6.if you pass the exam(admitted to graduate school),what are your plans during your postgraduate life.

If I pass the exam(admitted to graduate school).  I will work hard to keep study, fill the gap in professional knowledge. So I will study Java, which is a programming language that is widely used now. Get further understand of object-oriented programming. Though I have practiced it by create a small project. But I didn't have much experience on it. And other important courses cannot be ignored. I will deepen my understanding of computer network, operating system and algorithms. Of course, I will try my best to study academic research. Enrich my graduate life.

注记：继续努力学习，填补专业空缺，之后具体阐述学习哪些东西Java、面向对象编程，说明之前的练习成果，还有其他不可忽略的课程、学术研究。

## 7.have you had breakfast?which food did you eat?

Yes, I had. I drank a glass of milk and ate a piece of bread. Sometimes I don't eat breakfast. But I will have lunch early. Skipping breakfast is common among young people. why they skip this step I think maybe because get up late or just for save money. But we all know having breakfast helps you to be energetic in the morning and concentrate on your work and study. So... try to eat something as possible.

注记：一杯牛奶、一片面包。有时我不吃早饭，跳过早饭很常见，可能是因为起床晚了或者是单纯为了省钱，但是吃点早饭能帮助你集中精力学习和工作，所以还是吃点吧

## 8.what is your favorite sport?

My favorite sport is  badminton and table tennis. After study and work, people always need some entertainment to fill the rest time. Running is good choice. But I think running alone sometimes can be a little boring. Badminton and table tennis can not only exercise, but also enhance people's feeling. So I like it very much.

注记：羽毛球乒乓球，学习工作之余，人们需要一些休闲时间去填补。跑步挺不错，但是一个人跑步是在有点无聊，这两个运动不仅能够锻炼身体而且还能促进人与人之间的感情，所以我很喜欢他。

## 9.if you don't pass the exam,how do you confront with it?

I will seriously think on my shortcomings. Strive to improve my professional level.

## 10.how to face with the difficulty during postgraduate life?

If I can pass the test, I will continue to work hard to make up for my disadvantage in professional knowledge. Maybe I will have some difficulties in academic research, but I will try to overcome it. Sometimes we become very depressed because of a difficult problem, so it is also very important to relax appropriately. We can communicate more with our classmates and leave the heavy tasks behind temporarily. When you feel better, you will be more motivated to overcome these problems.

注记：如果能通过复试，继续努力工作弥补专业上的欠缺，可能会有学术研究上的困难，但是我会努力克服。有时会因为一些困难而沮丧，那么适当的放松就是必要的。可以和同学联系暂时把繁重的工作抛之脑后，当你感到好多了的时候，你讲更有信心去解决这些困难。

## 11.talk about your graduation thesis(design)

well.it not really relative to computer science. of course, I am not a computer science student. So why not talk about my little project.

## 12.why do you take the postgraduate entrance examination?

When I was doing practice in major. we used to bookkeeping by hands and papers, but it will consume a lot of time and people to do it. Accounting software have changed it .we leave some complex and repetitive things to the computer do. But the world is complicated. There are still many things that have not been implemented by computers. And I want to know how computer did it and promote its development using my financial and computer knowledge. So this is why I apply for our university to study software engineering. When I attend to work, I have more understand about of society ,and more understand of myself. So I have exactly plans for my future. I want to use my Interdisciplinary knowledge make my own contribution to society.

## 13.how to comment your university life

As we know, many people think that the college is free and comfortable. You can enjoy yourself during the four years. In high school, teachers always said that you will have the truly freedom when you go to the university. Well it not really correct. You can have fun in university. But study is the priority. Understanding the  combination of work and rest will be more helpful when you out of university and go to society in the future. So I made friends and gained happiness in my university life. At the same time , I also learned a lot of knowledge. I think my college life is meaningful.

注记：许多人觉得大学生活是自由舒服的，你可以尽情玩耍四年。高中时老师们说到大学就好了。但是在大学中学习和玩耍要兼顾

## 14.which research direction do you interest in?



## At the end of interview

Thank you for your compliment. I am far from perfect. I will continue to work hard in the future.

Thanks for your talking with me. is this time for the next stage?
