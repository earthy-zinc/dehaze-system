“This paper analyzes the data of marketing campaigns on e-commerce platforms, examines the interactive information and spreading power of users under a marketing campaign, proposes a trend prediction method of marketing campaign influence, and predicts the influence level of the marketing campaign in the next moment. Specifically, this paper discovers the multi-tag characteristics of users and the time sequence of marketing campaign influence under an e-commerce platform. To address these characteristics, this paper studies the relationship between multi-tag information through text representation to obtain key information in user tags, subsequently constructing an influence spreading network based on the neighbor user groups of key users, and finally proposes a marketing campaign influence trend prediction model K-LSTM based on the time-series characteristics of influence to analyze the changing trend of marketing campaign influence. Through comparative experiments using real data sets, the effectiveness and necessity of key information extraction, as well as the prediction effect of the influence trend prediction model proposed in this paper, is verified. However, our work has its own limitations. The focus of our current work is to uncover key users with influence, and we learn to measure multi-label information relationships through text representation to get key information about users, and then get the influence dissemination network. That key users have influence on surrounding users is the premise assumption of our study. How to implement a faster retrieval algorithm in the network is one of the focuses of our work in the future. In addition, it is worthwhile to further investigate how to refine the similarity of users, and it is also one of the directions we want to explore whether we can mine users’ interests through their behavioral sequence information and then implement similarity matching.” <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10046823%2Fitems%2FQHH84RXH%22%5D%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F10046823%2Fitems%2FQHH84RXH%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22article-journal%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22E-commerce%20platforms%20are%20committed%20to%20planning%20various%20marketing%20campaigns%20to%20make%20profits%2C%20and%20the%20impact%20of%20marketing%20campaigns%20is%20determined%20by%20the%20number%20of%20consumers%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20good%20or%20bad%20planning%20scheme.%20Therefore%2C%20accurate%20prediction%20of%20user%20behavior%20and%20comprehensive%20analysis%20of%20marketing%20campaign%20trends%20can%20help%20e-commerce%20platforms%20to%20identify%20quality%20marketing%20campaigns%2C%20which%20are%20crucial%20for%20developing%20e-commerce%20platforms.%20In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose%20a%20model%20for%20predicting%20the%20influence%20trend%20of%20marketing%20campaigns%20based%20on%20the%20key%20information%20between%20group%20users%20and%20marketing%20campaigns%20on%20e-commerce%20platforms.%20To%20begin%2C%20text%20representation%20learning%20is%20used%20to%20unify%20user%20representations%20to%20address%20the%20multi-label%20nature%20of%20platform%20users%2C%20considering%20that%20text%20representation%20learning%20can%20extract%20deeper%20correlations%20between%20different%20label%20information%20and%20learn%20key%20information%20in%20the%20marketing%20campaign-user%20network%20by%20mining%20the%20correlations%20between%20user%20labels.%20Furthermore%2C%20considering%20the%20leading%20power%20of%20key%20users%20in%20the%20e-commerce%20platform%2C%20the%20influential%20spread%20network%20is%20constructed%20for%20the%20characteristics%20of%20the%20group%20user%20network%20under%20the%20marketing%20campaign%20using%20the%20locality-sensitive%20hashing%20(LSH)%20algorithm%20and%20combined%20with%20the%20mining%20of%20key%20information%20in%20the%20marketing%20campaign-user%20network.%20Finally%2C%20to%20address%20the%20time-series%20nature%20of%20influence%20development%2C%20the%20influence%20spread%20network%20is%20fused%2C%20and%20the%20contextual%20relationships%20of%20the%20influence%20spread%20network%20are%20learned%20using%20a%20recurrent%20neural%20network%20(RNN)%20algorithm%20to%20propose%20a%20model%20for%20predicting%20the%20influence%20trend%20of%20marketing%20campaigns%20based%20on%20key%20information.%20Experiments%20have%20shown%20that%20the%20model%20can%20predict%20user%20engagement%20behavior%20in%20the%20context%20of%20a%20marketing%20campaign%2C%20as%20well%20as%20dynamically%20depict%20changes%20in%20trends%20in%20the%20influence%20of%20the%20campaign.%22%2C%22container-title%22%3A%22Expert%20Systems%20with%20Applications%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.1016%2Fj.eswa.2022.118575%22%2C%22ISSN%22%3A%2209574174%22%2C%22journalAbbreviation%22%3A%22Expert%20Systems%20with%20Applications%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22118575%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22DOI.org%20(Crossref)%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Influence%20prediction%20model%20for%20marketing%20campaigns%20on%20e-commerce%20platforms%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0957417422016360%22%2C%22volume%22%3A%22211%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Xiao%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Yunpeng%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Zhu%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Yu%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22He%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Weikang%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Huang%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Mengyang%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222022%22%2C12%2C20%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222023%22%2C1%5D%5D%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/QHH84RXH">Xiao 等, 2023</a></span>)</span>
