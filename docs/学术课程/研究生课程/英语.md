The author want to tell us in the first underlined sentence is that most of our experience in university is about learning, growth and transformation. University is the place to learn. We learned a lot of professional knowledge in university. This is why we should learn in university. After nine years of study, we went to university to learn the knowledge which is needed for life and work, and establish our outlook on life and values. This is about growth. Many people go to work after finishing university, so college is the vital period for our transformation. We are not used to the life when we out of school and first started working, most because we didn't make transformation during university.
